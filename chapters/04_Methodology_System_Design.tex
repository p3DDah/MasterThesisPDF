\chapter{Methodology and System Design}
\label{ch:Methodology_System_Design}

In this chapter, the methodology and system design for two distinct \ac{glosa} algorithms are described. These algorithms share the common goal of providing speed advice but differ fundamentally in their optimisation criteria and underlying logic. The first serves as a throughput-oriented baseline, \ac{flow-glosa}, while the second introduces a novel eco-driving strategy based on \ac{dp}, \ac{eco-glosa}.
\mynewline
The structure of the chapter is as follows: Section~\vref{sec:Baseline_Glosa_Algorithm} first establishes a performance benchmark by offering a thorough analysis of the baseline, throughput-oriented \ac{glosa} controller as implemented in \ac{sumo}. Subsequently, Section~\vref{sec:Proposed_Eco_Driving_GLOSA_Algorithm} presents the proposed eco-driving algorithm, outlining its design rationale, its formulation as a \ac{dp} problem to minimise fuel consumption, and its specific implementation details.
