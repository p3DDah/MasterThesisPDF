\chapter{Methodology and System Design}
\label{ch:Methodology_System_Design}

In this chapter, we describe the overall methodology and system design used to develop and assess two distinct \ac{glosa} algorithms, both founded on \ac{dp} but differing fundamentally in their objectives and implementations. Section \ref{sec:Baseline_Glosa_Algorithm} introduces the baseline, flow‐optimized \ac{glosa} algorithm, detailing its \ac{dp}‐based architecture, functional workflow, and implementation specifics. The section \ref{sec:Proposed_Eco_Driving_GLOSA_Algorithm} presents the eco‐driving \ac{glosa} algorithm. This operates under an entirely different optimisation criterion aimed at fuel efficiency. The design rationale for the algorithm is outlined, as well as the modifications to the \ac{dp} formulation, and implementation details.
