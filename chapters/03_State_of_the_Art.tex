Motorised road transport emitted nearly \SI{8}{\giga\tonne} of \ac{co2} in 2022, which accounted for over one-third of all end-use emissions \cite{IEATransport2024}. Reducing these emissions effectively requires an in-depth understanding of traffic dynamics and energy consumption at the individual vehicle trajectory level. Contemporary research in this area integrates high-fidelity microscopic traffic simulation, optimisation frameworks such as \ac{glosa}, and advanced control strategies.
\mynewline
This chapter provides a critical review of the state-of-the-art in such control strategies, with a specific focus on \ac{dp} approaches for \ac{glosa} systems. The subsequent discussion is organised as follows. First, \vref{sec:flow_glosa} examines \ac{dp}-based methods that are aimed at maximising traffic throughput. These methods compute optimal speed profiles to minimise stop-and-go behaviour and thus increase network capacity. Next, \vref{sec:eco_glosa} extends the review to frameworks that incorporate energy considerations, formulating an \ac{eco-glosa} algorithm that prioritises the minimisation of fuel consumption. Finally, \vref{sec:research_gap} synthesises the findings from the literature to identify the remaining research gaps that motivate the contributions of this thesis.
