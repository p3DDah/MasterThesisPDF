\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{ch:ResultsDiscussion}

The preceding chapters defined a rigorous simulation framework and parameter sweep for both flow-optimised and eco-driving \ac{glosa} controllers. We now explore how these algorithms perform under varying traffic loads and penetration rates, revealing their network-level and vehicle-level impacts.  
We open with an analysis of green‚Äêphase vehicle flow to understand discharge performance under connected control (\ref{sec:Results_GreenPhaseFlow}). From there, attention moves to vehicle dynamics: first average travel speed (\ref{sec:Results_MeanSpeed}), then stop frequency (\ref{sec:Results_Stops}), and finally driving smoothness via acceleration profiles (\ref{sec:Results_Smoothness}). Environmental consequences follow, as per-vehicle CO$_2$ and NO$_x$ emissions, quantify ecological benefit (\ref{sec:Results_Emissions}). A dedicated break-even analysis then pinpoints the critical penetration at which eco-driving gains outweigh flow-optimised advantages (\ref{sec:Results_BreakEven}). Computational viability comes next, comparing runtime overheads of the advisory loop and optimisation algorithm (\ref{sec:Results_Computational}). We conclude by synthesising these findings, discussing trade-offs and implications for real-world deployment (\ref{sec:Results_Discussion}).
