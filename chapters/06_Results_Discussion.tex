\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{ch:ResultsDiscussion}

The preceding chapters established a simulation framework and a detailed parameter sweep for both flow-optimised and eco-driving \ac{glosa} controllers. This chapter explores the performance of these algorithms under varying traffic loads and penetration rates, revealing their impacts at both network and vehicle levels.
\mynewline
The analysis begins with an examination of green-phase vehicle flow to assess discharge performance under varying \acp{mpr}. The emphasis then turns to vehicle dynamics, including average travel speed (\ref{sec:Results_MeanSpeed}), frequency of stops (\ref{sec:Results_Stops}), and driving smoothness as determined by acceleration profiles (\ref{sec:Results_Smoothness}). Subsequently, the environmental impact is quantified in \ref{sec:Results_Emissions} through per-vehicle \ac{co2} and \ac{nox} emissions to evaluate the ecological benefit. A dedicated break-even analysis (\ref{sec:Results_BreakEven}) then identifies the critical penetration threshold at which the advantages of the flow-optimised strategy outweigh those of the eco-driving approach. The computational feasibility of each approach is then compared by analysing the runtime overheads of the advisory method and optimisation algorithm (\ref{sec:Results_Computational}). The chapter concludes with a synthesis of these findings, a discussion of the observed trade-offs, and the resulting implications for real-world deployment (\ref{sec:Results_Discussion}).
