\chapter{Simulation Setup and Configuration}
\label{ch:SimulationSetupConfiguration}

For testing \ac{glosa} schemes at the signalized \emph{Neckartor} junction, this chapter sets up a standard way to do experiments. The investigation employs a microscopic network developed in \ac{sumo} and controlled via the \ac{traci} interface. This digital twin accurately replicates the junction's lane geometry, \ac{spat} phasing, and local diesel-ban regulations. Synthetically generated traffic demand, anchored to measured flow data, spans a wide range of conditions from free-flow to oversaturation.

The chapter is organized into three main sections. Section~\ref{sec:SimEnvironment} outlines the simulation environment, including the network configuration, vehicle fleet composition, \ac{eidm} parameters, and the emission logging setup. Section~\ref{sec:exec_protocol} specifies the execution protocol, which systematically varies traffic flow, \ac{glosa} market penetration, communication range, and other key parameters such as the slack time, \gls{tslack}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:performance_evaluation} defines the performance metrics used for evaluation, including vehicle stop counts, mean speed, fuel consumption, pollutant emissions, and break-even penetration rates.
