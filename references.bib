Currently available software tools for VANET research still lack the ability to asses the usability of vehicular applications. In this article, we present <u>Tra</u>ffic <u>C</u>ontrol <u>I</u>nterface (TraCI) a technique for interlinking road traffic and network simulators. It permits us to control the behavior of vehicles during simulation runtime, and consequently to better understand the influence of VANET applications on traffic patterns.In contrast to the existing approaches, i.e., generating mobility traces that are fed to a network simulator as static input files, the online coupling allows the adaptation of drivers' behavior during simulation runtime. This technique is not limited to a special traffic simulator or to a special network simulator. We introduce a general framework for controlling the mobility which is adaptable towards other research areas.We describe the basic concept, design decisions and the message format of this open-source architecture. Additionally, we provide implementations for non-commercial traffic and network simulators namely SUMO and ns2, respectively. This coupling enables for the first time systematic evaluations of VANET applications in realistic settings.},

Using real and generated floating-car and trajectory data, we systematically investigate following aspects: Data requirements and preparation, conceptional approach including local maximum-likelihood and global LSE calibration with several objective functions, influence of the data sampling rate and measuring errors, the effect of data smoothing on the calibration result, and model performance in terms of fitting quality, robustness, parameter orthogonality, completeness and plausible parameter values.}

abstract = {The ability to predict the response of a vehicle in a stream of traffic to the behaviour of its predecessor is important in estimating what effect changes to the driving environment will have on traffic flow. Various proposed to explain this behaviour have different strengths and weaknesses. The paper constructs a new model for the response of the following vehicle based on the assumption that each driver sets limits to his desired braking and acceleration rates. The parameters in the model correspond directly to obvious characteristics of driver behaviour and the paper goes on to show that when realistic values are assigned to the parameters in a simulation, the model reproduces the characteristics of real traffic flow.}

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems, can be used to reduce the energy consumption in modern vehicles. In particular, GLOSA systems provide driving strategies that can decrease both energy consumption and travel time. In this paper, we present a new method to calculate the optimal driving speeds based on traffic light data. To this end, a detailed formulation for the optimization problem is presented for a multi-segment route, based on an electric vehicle (EV) and traffic light models in an urban environment. Since this formulation results in a nonconvex optimization problem, a relaxation procedure is applied with a low calculation time. By using this procedure, a dynamic real-time speed advisory algorithm is developed. Numerical simulations showed improved performance over benchmark techniques. In particular, the proposed Dynamic-GLOSA solution’s performance was shown to be very close to that with a brute-force optimal solution but with a much shorter calculation time and has significant potential for energy saving.},

In the study, 64 publications between 2006 and 2019 where reviewed and classified according to a schema developed using thematic analysis of the selected publications. Among the findings were that the typical publication evaluates through simulation benefits for the equipped vehicle, leaving considerable gaps in investigations of societal effects. Additionally, there is a lack of investigation on driver behaviour, both for the equipped vehicle and for fellow road users—the ability to accurately model such behaviour is necessary for reliable simulation results.}
